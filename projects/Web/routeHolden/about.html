						&emsp; As I stood at the top of the mountain, I reflected on my life which once was troubled and abusive. Having been raised in Florida with parents who wanted nothing to do with me, I learned that the only person I could depend on is myself and my sister. Without hesitation, one day I decided to pack my belongings and do something for myself to be happy. We do only have one life to live, and I wasn’t living my best one. I now am a traveling photographer and blogger letting the world live through my travels as most don’t have the availability to do this.

                        &emsp; My name is Holden Barber and the purpose of this blog is to show that you don’t have to continue being unhappy, you just have to do what it takes to make that change and do what you truly want to do. My income for traveling is purely based on your generous donations and feel free to request a location. Nothing is out of the question! Thank you for visiting and enjoy the view!
